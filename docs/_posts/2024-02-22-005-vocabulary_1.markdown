# Vocabulary

## Simple transformation

For a simple transformation from English to Neutro,
consider the following rules:

1. **first and foremost**, eliminate ANY word that specifically
refers to a masculine or a feminine noun. E.g.

Let's try and define an initial simple grammar,
based on previous posts. We'll update that later on,
with variants and more complex grammar.

```lex
consonant    :=  [bdfgjklmnoprstvxz]
vowel        := [aeiou]

noun         := consonant{1,2} (vowel consonant{1,2})+
adjective    := vowel? consonant{1,2} (vowel consonant{1,2})* "a"
adjectives   := adjective | adjectives BLANK adjective
animal       := list_of_nouns_1
object       := list_of_nouns_2

a_thing      := (adjectives BLANK)? (animal | object)
the_thing    := "o" BLANK a_thing
anything     := (a_thing | the_thing)
things       := anything "e"
many_things  := things | many_things COMMA BLANK things

a_person     := (adjectives BLANK)? list_of_nouns_3
the_person   := "i" a_person
any_person   := (a_person | the_person)
people       := any_person "e"
group        := people | group people

anything     := (things | group | anything | any_person) COMMA BLANK

subject      := personal_pronoun | anything 
verb         := (vowel? consonant{1,2}) (vowel consonant{1,2})*
target       := subject
complement   := (preposition BLANK)? subject

basic_sentence := subject BLANK verb
                | subject BLANK complement
```
