# Sentences

## A basic sentence

We saw some examples in previous chapter. A simple sentence
could be a subject and a verb, or a subject, a verb, and a complement.

E.g.:

* `si be ofis` -> you (plural) are at the office
* `bild av ofise` -> the building has offices

## Let's add a few adjectives to that

* `biga` -> big
* `smola` -> small
* `tina` -> tiny
* `tola` -> tall
* `bela` -> beautiful
* `cirka` -> circular/round
* `kadra` -> square
* `ovala` -> oval
* `triga` -> triangular
* `recta` -> rectangular
* `reda` -> red
* `bula` -> blue
* `verda` -> green
* `yela` -> yellow
* `nera` -> black
* `blana` -> white
* `purla` -> purple
* `rosa` -> pink

Adjectives should follow the noun they qualify, e.g.:

* `nera cate` -> black cats
* `kadra toz` -> a square house
* `tola i` -> a beautiful person
* `o reda dog` -> the red dog
* `e blana cate` -> the white cats

You will notice that all adjectives end in `a`. It's not a
coincidence. In case of using several adjectives, and
differently from English, the order
will show the level of importance, starting with the most
qualifying adjective, e.g.: `reda biga toz` -> a big red
house (with emphasis on red).

## A note on the/a

As you saw in above examples, `i`, `o`, and `e` alone can be used
to define the noun. Remember that `i` is for a person, `o` for an
object or animal, and `e` for the plural.

So, **the** beautiful people, will be `e bela i` (or `e bela ie`,
although that would create a diphthong), whilst **the** beautiful
person is simply `i bela i`, and **a** beautiful person is `bela i`.
