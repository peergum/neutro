# Vocabulary

## Preliminary note

This is a WIP and not a definitive guide. Things will likely change.

## Simple transformation

For a simple transformation from English to Neutro,
consider the following rules:

1. **first and foremost**, eliminate ANY word that specifically
   refers to a masculine or a feminine noun, and replace it with
   a generic neutral word instead. E.g. woman/man -> person
1. transform any [ah] sound (as in `bad`, `battle`...) into the letter `a`
1. transform any [ay] sound (as in `late`, `bed`...) into the letter `e`
1. transform any [i] sound (as in `bee`, `pin` ...) into the letter `i`
1. transform any [o] sound (as in `bowl`, `hawk`, `bored`, `boat` ...) into the letter `o`
1. transform any [u] sound (as in `foot` ....) into the letter `u`
1. for diphthongs, keep the most significant sound, e.g:
   - `road` -> `rod`
   - `route` -> `rut`
   - `colour` -> `color`
1. if above rule doesn't have an obvious outcome, keep the first letter
