# Verbs

## Basic verbs

Let's start with simple states or actions.

To be and to have seem a good start, so let's consider
* `be` --> to be
* `av` --> to have

*note*:
We'll consider `H` a mute letter as in most latin language, since besides etymology it's pretty useless
on its own.  

## Personal pronouns

Let's also define a way to address ourselves or the people we're with:
* `im` -> I
* `is` -> you
* `it` -> them (singular, neutral)
* `mi` -> we
* `si` -> you (plural)
* `ti` -> them (plural)

Note the `i` letter, which represent a person (we'll get back to that in a moment), and the associated letter:
* `m` -> 1st person
* `s` -> 2nd person
* `t` -> 3rd person

The position of the added letter correspond to singular or plural.

### Some examples:
* I am -> `im be`
* we are -> `mi be`
* he/she has -> `it av`

## Object pronouns

We see here that the `i` letter represents a person (neutral). Similarly `o` represents an object or
an animal, and is used the same:
* `om` -> kind of non-sense, unless referring to myself as an object
* `os` -> you (to a dog for instance)
* `ot` -> it (or he/she for a pet)
* `mo` -> us, as objects or abstract people (e.g. mankind)
* `so` -> you, talking directly to or about several objects/animals
* `to` -> them, the objects/animals
