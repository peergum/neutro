# Grammar

## Preliminary note

This is an initial attempt at defining and expressing a grammar. The syntax used is temporary and may not
conform to existing standards (BNF and variations). Consider it a WIP, subject to constant change, and
this post WILL get updated.

Some of the rules may even contradict the practical examples given previously, since I'm hoping to make
the language easily "parse-able" and that may requires tweaking the definition of certain words.

I'm considering in parallel ways to translate to and from English, learning and experimenting with tools like
lex/yacc (flex/bison) and ANTLR4. Stay tuned.

## Simple grammar

Let's try and define an initial simple grammar,
based on previous posts. We'll update that later on,
with variants and more complex grammar.

```
consonant    =  [bdfgjklmnoprstvxz]
vowel        = [aeiou]

noun         ::= consonant{1,2} (vowel consonant{1,2})+
adjective    ::= vowel? consonant{1,2} (vowel consonant{1,2})* "a"
adjectives   ::= adjective | adjectives BLANK adjective
animal       ::= list_of_nouns_1
object       ::= list_of_nouns_2

a_thing      ::= (adjectives BLANK)? (animal | object)
the_thing    ::= "o" BLANK a_thing
anything     ::= (a_thing | the_thing)
things       ::= anything "e"
many_things  ::= things | many_things COMMA BLANK things

a_person     ::= (adjectives BLANK)? list_of_nouns_3
the_person   ::= "i" a_person
any_person   ::= (a_person | the_person)
people       ::= any_person "e"
group        ::= people | group people

anything     ::= (things | group | anything | any_person) COMMA BLANK

subject      ::= personal_pronoun | anything 
verb         ::= (vowel? consonant{1,2}) (vowel consonant{1,2})*
target       ::= subject
complement   ::= (preposition BLANK)? subject

basic_sentence ::= subject BLANK verb
                | subject BLANK complement
                | subject BLANK verb BLANK complement
```

(to be continued...)
