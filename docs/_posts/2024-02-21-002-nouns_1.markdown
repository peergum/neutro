# Nouns

Let's define a few useful nouns

* `caz` -> Home
* `rod` -> Road
* `toz` -> House
* `bild` -> Building
* `skol` -> School
* `fis` -> Office

### A quick note on pronounciation

As for `H` mentioned earlier, we're targeting a simple pronounciation.
For that matter, there's no variation on the sounds of letters, or any
variation is irrelevant to the meaning.

For instance `a` will have the same "role", independently of the
place in the word, or the letters around it. It can be pronounced, `ah` or
`ay`, that won't make a difference.

Consequently, `caz` could be pronounced like `kaz` or like `case`, that
will still be the same word.

The vowel sounds will be `a` [ah], `e` [ay], `i` [ee], `o` [oh], `u` [u].

We should also avoid any [diphthong][diphthong], so we don't confuse the
reader/listener. In simpler terms, don't use two vowels in sequence.

[diphthong]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong

### Practical considerations

Nouns will **always** start and end with a consonant.

## Plural

The plural of nouns should be simple and guessable. We'll use the letter `e` for that.

* `caz` -> `caze` [kazay]
* `rod` -> `rode` [roday]
* `toz` -> `toze` [tozay]
* `bild` -> `bilde` [bilday]
* `skol` -> `skole` [skolay]
* `fis` -> `fise` [fissay]
* `dog` -> `doge` [dogay]
* `cat` -> `cate` [catay]

For that reason, nouns should not finish in `e` in singular form.
Similarly, due to the special meaning of `i` (person) and `o` (object),
nouns should not end with these letters, unless specifically
designing a person or an object/animal.

## Examples

* `im av toz` -> I have a house
* `it be skol` -> he or she is (at) school
* `to be caz` -> they (objects/animals) are (at) home

Note that, similarly to English, we don't need to use a preposition for
"at".

That will lead to our next chapter on sentences.
