This site is an attempt at creating a universal language
with neutrality in mind, i.e. the absence of gender specificity.

It is **not** based on any research or similar/parallel works,
and is mostly an attempt at starting from scratch and
building up the language.

References ("words") from other languages might be used and
built upon, to ease learning or remember the language
structure.

Please bear with me: I'm no linguist, not exceptionally
literate, and my only intention is to remove the hassle
of genderism in languages, since there's no
actual point for that - unless someone proves me to the
contrary.
